Problem: Must use the GIPHY API to make a dynamic web page that populates with gifs of user's choice. Must call the GIPHY API and use JavaScript and jQuery to change the HTML of site.

Solution: Call GIPHY API and use jQuery to update which Gifs are displaying, and use JavaScript to allow the Gifs to change from moving to still based on whether or not the user has clicked a Gif.

Technical Approach: Use JavaScript logic to parse moving vs. still Gifs, to allow for the user to click on displaying Gifs to make them move or pause.
